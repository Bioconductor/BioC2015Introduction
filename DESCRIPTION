Description: This course is directed at beginning and intermediate
    individuals who would like an introduction to the analysis and
    comprehension of high-throughput sequence data using R and
    Bioconductor. We start with learning essential background: an
    introduction to the R programming language; central concepts for
    effective use of Bioconductor software; and an overview of
    high-throughput sequence analysis work flows. Then we emphasize use
    of Bioconductor for specific tasks. The course combines lectures with
    extensive hands-on practicals; students are required to bring a
    laptop with wireless internet access and a modern version of the
    Chrome or Safari web browser.
